# NeuroVerse

**Offline Android AI chat with a modular plugin framework (automation coming soon).**

NeuroVerse is a privacy‑first Android app that runs fully on‑device and showcases a plugin‑based architecture. The current public milestone is **chat‑only** via the first‑party **AI Chat** plugin. The command/automation engine exists in the codebase but is **disabled and not user‑facing yet**.

## Status

* **Current:** Chat‑only experience using the built‑in **AI Chat** plugin.
* **Planned:** Command JSON generation, action validation, and on‑device UI automation are in development and will ship in future releases.

---

## What you can do today

* Local AI chat with a clean Material 3 UI.
* Load first‑party sample plugins to explore the plugin lifecycle and UI embedding.
* Build the app from source and experiment with the plugin API while automation is WIP.

---

## Official plugins

First‑party plugins live here: [https://github.com/Siddhesh2377/Neuro-V-Sys-Plugins](https://github.com/Siddhesh2377/Neuro-V-Sys-Plugins)

Available modules:

* `ai-chat` (current focus)
* `app-io` (under active development)
* `demo-macro` (prototype; not user‑facing yet)

Each module can be exported to a **plugin.zip** containing `plugin.aar` and `Manifest.json`, which NeuroVerse can import at runtime.

### Plugin integration overview

* **Manifest:** declare `entryClass` in `src/main/Manifest.json` (for example, `com.mp.ai_chat.ChatScreenPlugin`).
* **Packaging:** produce `plugin.zip` with `plugin.aar` and `Manifest.json`.
* **Loading:** import the zip from within NeuroVerse; the host validates and registers it.
* **UI:** plugins may provide Jetpack Compose screens rendered within the app.

See the plugin repo README for the `exportPluginZip` task and packaging details.

## Roadmap

* Ship command generation and validator in a public build
* Accessibility‑based action runner with safety guardrails
* In‑app plugin gallery and submission flow
* Basic task inspector and execution logs
* Small, pre‑bundled model for first‑run offline chat

Feedback is welcome in Issues and Discussions.
